# The Builders
Woohoo! We are so happy that you want to help out! Here are some sections that might be
helpful to start you off to learn about how to contribute a builder.

 - [Environment](/builders/environment): shared environment variables across all builder bundles
 - [Builder Flow](/builders/builder-flow): read here to understand the general builder flow, or how a static file here is ultimately deployed to build a container.
 - [Google Compute & Storage](/builders/builder-google-compute): build on Google Compute Engine, and upload to Storage.


If a new environment or endpoint is added, we will update the documentation here.
