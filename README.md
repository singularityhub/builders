# The Builders

For user friendly documentation, see [our docs](https://singularityhub.github.io/builders/). The manifest of builders [is here](https://vsoch.github.io/builders/configs.json). An overview will be provided here as well! This code base is under development, so expect to see more soon. It works as follows:

 1. This is the library of build configurations, organized in [_cloud](https://github.com/singularityhub/builders/tree/master/_cloud/) by environment, and operating system. 
 2. When you launch a builder with the `sregistry` client, you have different ways to select build configurations from here.
 3. The build is run, and the result uploaded to Storage, again per the builder bundle.

For the start of developer's documentation, [see here](https://singularityhub.github.io/builders/).

**under development** and everything subject to change!  - [@vsoch](https://www.github.com/vsoch)
